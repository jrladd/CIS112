In this project, you will transform your organization and roadmap into a fully functional database using PostgreSQL and Notepad++ (or a similar text-editor).\nTo ensure consistency across your databases, you will first obtain a copy of the ERD Dr. Ladd and Dr. Rapp built from this dataset. The version you obtain will not be the only correct way to organize this dataset, but it will be the roadmap of the data I will provide for large-scale querying during of this project. Your first task, then, will be to compare your Project I ERD to the class-uniform Project II ERD. You will write a brief essay (300 - 750 words) comparing your ERD to mine, and either arguing to defend your organization or making observations of where you could have improved your organization.\nYou will then build a complete schema, with full referential integrity, based on the class-uniform Project II ERD. Your code should follow the best practices of the class and follow the ERD exactly. You will be provided with a larger dataset to store in your functional database, and you will then be tasked with building 20 queries. Dr. Ladd will post the output of such queries; you will be expected to produce the exact output from your databases. You are expected to work on this project out of class until the due date of Friday, Oct. 27. Recall from the syllabus that you are not permitted to collaborate with your classmates for this project; you may seek guidance from me or the PAL tutors. For the purposes of this project, consider me to be your client and the PAL tutors to be your development team. You are developing this database for me, and to ensure timely completion I will require pieces of the project are required for submission before the final due date.\nCheck-in dates:\n\nFriday, October 6: Essay check-in, submitted complete draft as a PDF through Sakai; Required queries / output posted.\nFriday, October 13: DDL check-in, submitted as a .sql file through Sakai.\nFriday, October 20: DML check-in, submitted as a .sql file through Sakai.\nFriday, October 27: Final submission: all project files are submitted through Sakai for grading\n\nThe following criteria will be followed to evaluate this assignment on a 100-pt scale:\n\n25 pts: Data Definition follows the ERD to produce a database with referential integrity.\n50 pts: Data Manipulation effectively inserts/updates the data and builds the requested queries.\n25 pts: Essay detailing the differences between your Project I work and the class provided ERD."

Sample topics could include…\nYou may not build a database from a dataset of sports statistics or about professional athletes. You may not collect data about people without working with W&J’s Institutional Review Board. If you would like to collect data for your final project, please meet with me ASAP!\nYour database must feature no less than eight tables1, store a minimum of 25 attributes and 80 rows across all tables2, and store ten reasonably distinct queries representing documented use-cases. Those queries must make use of the following operations:\nYou will also add a minimum of two trigger functions to automatically perform certain transactions within your system. You must use a minimum of three SQL keywords that were not covered in class.\nYou must provide all relevant documentation as a single PDF which you will name “README.pdf”, to make obvious to the users of your system that it is intended for them to read! The README should be a cohesive document with good flow and must feature your database’s purpose and classification, three user personas3, a use-case diagram illustrating the actions that intended actors can perform, the complete data dictionary and entity relationship diagram documenting your database design, and instructions written for the person developing your interface detailing the function calls for the particular use-cases you’ve designed your system to support4.\nYou are expected to work on this project out of class until the due date of 10:20am on Monday, December 4. You are welcome to work with your peers, with the PAL tutors, and with me on this project, but if you choose the same database as a friend you may not share queries, trigger functions, or new keywords unless given written permission from me. To ensure timely completion and prevent end-of-semester stress due to procrastination, I will require pieces of the project submission before the final due date. Here is the timeline for the final project:\nThe following criteria will be followed to evaluate this assignment on a 100-pt scale:"

For the Project I & II system, one might write the following as an instruction: “Users are able to search for the phone number of a particular contact (e.g., John Marine). The function query_contact_phone takes two text arguments, representing the first and last name for the contact of interest.

The provided dataset is adapted from the Western PA Regional Data Center’s release of the Toxic Release Inventory from Allegheny County; these results should be considered a reduced copy of what is mandated to be reported and monitored by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We shall assume that the database you build will be used by local municipalities to monitor toxic releases within their counties and especially near school districts and parks.\nYour first task is to normalize the dataset; you’ll create an Excel file, with one Sheet per table, that indicates all primary keys in bold and color coordinates the foreign key connections between the tables. You’ll then create a single README, or a PDF document to accompany a dataset which contains relevant details that all users are expected to read as a starting point. The README must contain a dependency diagram with all full functional dependencies indicated, a complete physical ERD documenting the normalized schema, a Data Dictionary which associates the column names with their relevant descriptions, and a reflective essay (1-2 pages) detailing your organizational choices and how they serve the way people will use this dataset. Your reflection will use the technical terms we define in class and should discuss the contributions others made to your choices. The README will also contain all citations and references.\nYou are expected to work on this project out of class until the due date of Friday, September 22. Recall from the syllabus that you are permitted to ask your classmates for help with this project provided you cite their contributions to your work; you are also encouraged to seek guidance from me or from the PAL tutors.\nYou may consider me to be your client for this project and the associated Project II. In an industry setting, you’ll be expected to communicate with your client during the development of your product; to help you practice this, along with the specific database design skills you’ll demonstrate, I have a few checkpoints to impose prior to the final due date. These are intended to help you make steady progress on the project, so that by the final deadline all your work will be polished and complete.\nThis breakdown identifies all the important dates:\n\nWednesday, September 6: You will upload an in-progress Dependency Diagram as a photo through Sakai.\nFriday,September 8: You will upload an in-progress Excel file to Sakai to confirm navigational accessibility.\nFriday, September 15: You will upload an in-progress README as a PDF to Sakai to confirm formatting.\nFriday, September 22: A completed Excel file and README are submitted through Sakai.\n\nThe following categories will be my criteria to evaluate this assignment on a 100-pt scale:\n\n35 pts: All relations are well-formed; data has been normalized following your dependency diagram.\n35 pts: The schema you developed and its contents are well documented using a physical ERD.\n30 pts: Data Dictionary and Reflection support the decisions documented in the Excel file and ERD."

This isn’t an accounting of how often you speak in class. Instead, it’s about what you offer to the intellectual life of the class, and everyone contributes to this on-going work in different ways.

If you have to miss class for any reason, please let me know in advance, especially if you have to miss more than one class in a row.

When you email about an extension, please propose a new deadline for the assignment (a good rule of thumb is 2 or 3 days after the original deadline). Any work received late without an agreed-upon extension will be penalized one point per day.\nBut keep in mind: I cannot accept any assignment more than one week late.

Please do not feel the need to change your name or pronouns to “make it easy” for me, and please correct me if I get it wrong! This policy goes for everyone—use the names and pronouns dictated by the person to whom they belong. Also, our personal growth does not always align with the semester system: If your name or pronoun changes part way through the class, please send me an update!\n\n\n\nPlease be respectful with your use of laptops and technology in class.

    "text": "Important Resources for this Class and Your College Journey\n\nMental Health\nWhat we do in college is not easy, on many fronts. Students are challenged with feelings of depression, anxiety, and self harm at astonishingly high rates. Learning is hard, and you will likely be challenged in college in ways that you haven’t experienced before. Learning while life is hard is even harder. Please take care of yourself. Drink water, eat well, and get more than seven hours of sleep. Have some hobbies, but don’t feel the need to do everything. If you are feeling depressed, withdrawn, anxious, like an impostor, or you are having specific problems with harassment, assault, bias, etc., please seek help. There are many resources on campus, and my door and email are always open.\nW&J’s Student Health and Counseling Center offers confidential counseling services: https://www.washjeff.edu/student-life/student-health-and-counseling-center/\n\n\nDisability Support Services\nWashington & Jefferson College is committed to providing academic accommodations for students with disabilities. This includes individuals with physical disabilities, learning disabilities, and mental health disorders that meet the definition of a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students who plan to request accommodations should contact the Director for Academic Success as early as possible, although requests may be made at any time. To determine whether you qualify for accommodations, or if you have questions about services and procedures, please call 724-223-6008 or send an email to dss@washjeff.edu.\n\n\nW&J Library\nI highly recommend that you make use of the W&J Library resources while navigating your essays this semester. That includes not only primary literature, access to databases, and book references, but also the friendly members of the library staff. They are excellent resources for finding information efficiently, or learning what you can access through W&J subscriptions that might not be freely available on the internet. The W&J Library homepage is https://libguides.washjeff.edu/home.\n\n\nWriting Center\nStaffed by student Peer Writing Tutors, the Writing Center is a free resource available to all W&J students. Writing Tutors from many majors help writers one-on-one in all phases of the writing process, from deciphering assignments, to discussing ideas, to developing an argument, to finalizing a draft. Because proofreading is a last step in that process, you should leave plenty of time (like at least a week) for getting your ideas right before expecting proofreading help. Consultants also can help writers with personal documents, like job and internship applications. The Center welcomes student writers with all varieties of backgrounds and college preparation, including multilingual writers. Please visit the Writing Center’s page (https://mywj.washjeff.edu/office/writing-center) on MyW&J for specific information regarding hours of availability and how to schedule an appointment.\n\n\nCautions regarding copyright and licensing\nAll documents provided to you (i.e. syllabus, paper prompts, tests, etc…) are the property of the instructor or author. It is a violation of intellectual property to post these online (especially to websites promoting copying/cheating) or to provide them to students not in our class or in future classes. Your papers are your property, and while you can do with them as you wish, it may be a violation of academic integrity to make them available to others who might use them for plagiarism. Basically, keep course materials and your work to yourself except in the process of editing and peer review.\n\n\nInclusion and Diversity\nThis course is open to anyone interested in databases and related technologies. It is my intent to make all students feel welcome and served in this course by addressing their learning needs. We all (including myself) are continuously learning about different lived experiences. In this course, if you encounter anything said (intentionally or unintentionally) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. If your learning is impacted by your background, or any life event going on outside of class, feel free to talk to me. Even if you choose not to share details, I would be happy to direct you to the right resources on campus.\nI acknowledge that each of you has their own specific life history, family context, identity, body—and that these realities have an impact on how you understand and interact with our course materials. Therefore, I ask you to generally familiarize yourself with the content of our discussions ahead of time, and if for any reason you believe you will be unable to participate in a discussion of certain themes or elements, please contact me beforehand and/or seek the support of any of the formal or informal resources available to you on campus, some of which are included in this syllabus. I look forward to creating a safe learning environment together this semester!"
